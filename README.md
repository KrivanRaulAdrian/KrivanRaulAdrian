### Raul - Student PHP Developer 🐘

I have one year of experience working as a user support specialist. I'm a student at Jagaad Academy and have been focusing on Backend development with PHP, Symfony, MySQL, and Object-Oriented Programming. Check out some of my projects here on GitHub; they cover different topics I'm studying 📚.

- Currently, I'm looking for an opportunity to work as a junior or intern developer. 💻 🐘
